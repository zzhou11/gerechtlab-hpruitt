# SETTING UP GIT ON YOUR MAC AND HOW IT WORKS

Git basically allows for version control (track changes) on a project for multiple users. On Mac, this is done through the Terminal. 

First, let's establish the concept of a remote and local repository. GitHub is the remote repository, where all the project code is stored. A local repository is located on your computer. You must set up a "link" between the two repositories to keep both updated and in sync. 

To set up a local repository: 

# Codes for T-cell tracking analysis in MatLab. 
# Use initData to convert excel data to processable matrix
# Make sure to read the specifications for each function before using it, all of them should use standard dataset (column 1 is the track number, column 2 is the slice number (starts from 1, ascending order, no skips), and column 3 is x coordinate, column 4 is y coordinates. All tracks should be grouped together.
