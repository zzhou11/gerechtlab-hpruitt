# Codes for T-cell tracking analysis in MatLab. 
# Use initData to convert excel data to processable matrix
# Make sure to read the specifications for each function before using it, all of them should use standard dataset (column 1 is the track number, column 2 is the slice number (starts from 1, ascending order, no skips), and column 3 is x coordinate, column 4 is y coordinates. All tracks should be grouped together.
